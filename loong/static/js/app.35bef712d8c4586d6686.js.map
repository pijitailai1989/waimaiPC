<p>【审慎阅读】您在申请注册流程中点击同意本协议之前，应当认真阅读本协议。请您务必审慎阅读、充分理解各条款内容，特别是免除或者限制责任的条款、法律适用和争议解决条款。免除或者限制责任的条款将以粗体下划线标识，您应重点阅读。</p>\r\n                <h3>一、 概述</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    第一条 &nbsp;本服务协议双方为湖州莘达科技有限公司旗下产品“loong外卖”（下称“loong外卖”）与loong外卖产品用户，本服务协议具有合同效力。\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    第二条 &nbsp;本服务协议内容包括协议正文及所有loong外卖已经发布的或将来可能发布的各类规则。所有规则为协议不可分割的一部分，与协议正文具有同等法律效力。\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    第三条 &nbsp;用户在使用loong外卖提供的各项服务的同时，承诺接受并遵守各项相关规则的规定。loong外卖有权根据需要不定时地制定、修改本协议或各类规则。如本协议有任何变更，loong外卖将在产品上刊载公告，通知予用户。如用户不同意相关变更，必须停止使用“服务”。经修订的协议一经在loong外卖产品公布后，立即自动生效。各类规则会在发布后生效，亦成为本协议的一部分。登录或继续使用“服务”将表示用户接受经修订的协议。除另行明确声明外，任何使 “服务”范围扩大或功能增强的新内容均受本协议约束。\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>二、 定义</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    第四条 &nbsp;loong外卖的用户： 用户为具备完全民事行为能力的自然人。无民事行为能力人、限制民事行为能力人不当注册为loong外卖用户或超过其民事权利或行为能力范围从事交易的，其与loong外卖之间的服务协议自始无效，loong外卖一经发现，有权立即注销该用户，并追究其使用loong外卖“服务”的一切法律责任。\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    第五条 &nbsp;用户注册是指用户登录loong外卖产品，并按要求填写相关信息并确认同意履行相关用户协议的过程。用户因进行交易，获取订餐的有偿服务或接触loong外卖产品服务器而发生的所有应纳税赋，以及一切硬件、软件、服务及其他方面的费用均由用户负责支付。loong外卖产品仅作为订餐的交易平台。\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    第六条 &nbsp;loong外卖网上订餐系统： 由loong外卖自主开发，提供给用户进行产品上交易的平台软件，用户可以使用此系统进行订单和积分管理、商户可以使用此系统进行店铺和外卖信息的发布和订单管理。\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>三、 用户的权利和义务</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    第七条 &nbsp;为了给广大用户营造一个健康、有序的网络服务交易平台，loong外卖对商户资质采取严格审核、紧密合作的方式，最大程度屏蔽用户虚假订单，减少餐馆的损失。loong外卖倡导诚信交易，并为此提供一系列的解决方案。\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    loong外卖为用户提供交易平台，loong外卖只能部分控制交易所涉及的产品的质量、安全或合法性、商贸信息的真实性或准确性，以及交易方履行其在贸易协议下的各项义务的能力。鉴于loong外卖平台具备存在海量信息及信息网络环境下信息与实物相分离的特点，loong外卖平台无法逐一审查商品及或服务的信息，无法逐一审查交易所涉及的商品及或服务的质量、安全以及合法性、真实性、准确性，对此您应谨慎判断。\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    第八条 &nbsp;普通用户的权利：\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    (一)

&nbsp;用户有权利使用loong外卖网上订餐系统和loong外卖商户在线取得直接联系，以获得最新的菜品信息和相关增值服务；用户点击“去结算”按钮后系统会自动生成包含商品名称、购买数量、应付总额、收货地址（如有）等信息的订单，用户应仔细核对。用户点击订单底部的“去支付”按钮，视为用户已阅读并同意外卖页面的所有内容并认可订单内容，订单内容及外卖页面信息视为用户与商户、配送服务商之间的外卖交易合同。\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    (三)

&nbsp;用户在loong外卖交易过程中如与商户因交易产生纠纷，可以请求loong外卖从中予以协调。对因商户或平台配送团队原因在整个物流配送过程中导致的货物损坏、损毁、灭失等情况，将由对应责任方承担赔偿责任，loong外卖将根据平台规则，积极配合用户对该部分损失进行追偿。用户如发现其他用户有违法或违反本服务协议的行为，可以向loong外卖进行反映要求处理。如用户因交易与其他用户产生诉讼的，用户有权通过司法部门要求loong外卖提供相关资料。\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    第九条 &nbsp;普通用户的义务：\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    (一) &nbsp;用户有义务在注册时提供自己的真实资料，并保证诸如电子邮件地址、联系电话、联系地址、邮政编码等内容的有效性及安全性，保证loong外卖及其他用户可以通过上述联系方式与自己进行联系。同时，用户也有义务在相关资料实际变更时及时更新有关注册资料。用户保证不以他人资料在loong外卖产品进行注册或认证。若用户使用虚假电话、姓名、地址或冒用他人信息使用loong外卖订餐服务，loong外卖将做出相应处罚或屏蔽地址的处理；\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    (二) &nbsp;用户不应在loong外卖网上订餐平台上恶意评价其他商户，或采取不正当手段提高自身的信用度或降低其他商户的信用度；\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n
